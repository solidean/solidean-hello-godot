SOFTWARE COMMUNITY LICENSE AGREEMENT
(SOLIDEAN COMMUNITY EDITION)

This Software Community License Agreement (“Agreement”) is a legally binding agreement between
Shaped Code GmbH (“Licensor”) and any individual or legal entity that downloads, installs, accesses,
or uses the Licensed Technology (“Licensee”).

BY DOWNLOADING, INSTALLING, ACCESSING, OR USING THE LICENSED TECHNOLOGY, YOU AGREE TO BE
BOUND BY THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE, DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL, ACCESS, OR USE
THE LICENSED TECHNOLOGY.

Licensor: Shaped Code GmbH, Germany
Contact: solidean@shapedcode.com

Licensed Technology:
Solidean Mesh Processing Toolkit (the “Licensed Technology”)

This Community Edition is intended for learning, research, evaluation, and experimentation. 
It is not a production or commercial license. If the Licensed Technology becomes operationally 
important to a business, a commercial license is required.


---

1. Purpose and Scope

Licensor is the sole proprietor of all exploitation rights in the Licensed Technology.

This Agreement grants Licensee the right to use the Licensed Technology under the terms of the
Solidean Community Edition. The purpose of this license is to enable broad access to the Licensed
Technology for research, evaluation, experimentation, and non-commercial use, while reserving
commercial operation, production use, and deployment for separately licensed agreements.

“Licensee” means any individual or legal entity that downloads, installs, accesses, or uses the
Licensed Technology.


---

2. Permitted Uses (Community Edition)

Subject to the restrictions set forth in this Agreement, Licensee is granted a non-exclusive,
non-transferable, non-assignable, non-sublicensable right to use the Licensed Technology for the
following purposes:

a) Personal use, experimentation, and learning.

b) Academic and scientific research, including research conducted at or in cooperation with
   commercial entities, provided that the Licensed Technology itself is not commercially operated
   or deployed.

c) Internal evaluation, benchmarking, prototyping, and testing of the Licensed Technology,
   including integration into experimental or prototype systems.

d) Development and testing of software that integrates with the Licensed Technology, including
   deployment of such software to internal users or external testers (including beta testers),
   provided that:

   - the Licensed Technology itself is not redistributed or hosted by Licensee, and
   - such deployment is for evaluation, testing, or validation purposes and not part of a
     commercial service or product offering.

e) Open-source software projects may implement optional integration or
   interoperability with the Licensed Technology, provided that:

   - the Licensed Technology (including any core binary components) is not
     distributed, bundled, or sublicensed as part of the open-source project;
   - the open-source project treats the Licensed Technology solely as an
     optional external dependency that users must obtain separately from
     Licensor; and
   - all use of the Licensed Technology remains subject to this Agreement.

   The open-source license governing such projects does not apply to, and does
   not grant any rights in, the Licensed Technology. For the avoidance of doubt,
   integration or linking of any technical form does not grant any right to
   redistribute the core binary components of the Licensed Technology.

The rights granted under this Agreement may not be assigned or transferred, whether by operation
of law or otherwise, without the prior written consent of Licensor.


---

3. Prohibited Uses (Commercial Operation)

Except under a separate written commercial license agreement with Licensor, Licensee may not use
the Licensed Technology for any form of commercial operation.

“Commercial operation” means use of the Licensed Technology as a required, material, or 
relied-upon component of:

a) any product or service that is sold, licensed, monetized, or otherwise offered for commercial
   gain;

b) any hosted service, cloud offering, or software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution, including any
   form of remote or on-demand access to functionality provided by the Licensed Technology;

c) any internal system, pipeline, or tool that is relied upon for regular business operations,
   production workflows, manufacturing, service delivery, or revenue-generating activities;

d) any customer-facing deliverable, whether provided directly or indirectly as part of a paid
   engagement or commercial contract.

Commercial operation is determined by the factual use of the Licensed Technology and is not 
avoided by indirect use, including use through third-party software, open-source projects, 
wrappers, or integration layers.

If removal of the Licensed Technology would reasonably be expected to disrupt or prevent the
delivery of a commercial product, service, or revenue-generating workflow, such use constitutes
commercial operation and requires a commercial license.


---

4. Distribution and Redistribution

Licensee may not distribute, sublicense, rent, lease, lend, sell, or otherwise make available the
core executable components of the Licensed Technology (including but not limited to shared
libraries, dynamic libraries, or executables), whether in object, binary, or compiled form, to any
third party.

This prohibition includes making the Licensed Technology available through hosting, container
images, virtual machines, download services, or similar mechanisms that allow third parties to
obtain or use the core binary components.

Source code components provided as part of the Licensed Technology that are not required to execute
or operate the core functionality (including headers, SDK helpers, examples, and integration
utilities) may be distributed by Licensee, provided that:

a) such distribution does not include or enable redistribution of the core binary components; and
b) such distribution does not grant any rights to the core binary components beyond those set forth
   in this Agreement.

Any reproduction of the Licensed Technology is permitted solely to the extent necessary for lawful
use under this Agreement, including reasonable backup copies made in accordance with technical
standards.


---

5. Modifications and Reverse Engineering

Licensee may modify software components of the Licensed Technology that are provided in source code
form, solely for uses permitted under this Agreement.

For the avoidance of doubt, any distribution or disclosure of modified or unmodified components
remains subject to the restrictions set forth in Section 4 (Distribution and Redistribution).

For binary-only components, Licensee may decompile or reverse engineer the Licensed Technology only
to the extent expressly permitted by applicable law, in particular Sections 69c and 69e of the
German Copyright Act (UrhG) or equivalent provisions of applicable local law.


---

6. Intellectual Property

Except for the limited rights expressly granted under this Agreement, all rights, title, and
interest in and to the Licensed Technology, including all intellectual property rights, remain
exclusively with Licensor.

Licensee may not remove or alter any copyright notices, proprietary legends, or identification
marks contained in the Licensed Technology.

WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED, OR STATUTORY, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, ACCURACY, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.

TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, LICENSOR SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY DAMAGES
ARISING FROM THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE THE LICENSED TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING DIRECT, INDIRECT,
INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR SPECIAL DAMAGES.

7.1 No Implied License

Union, the United States, and other applicable jurisdictions.


---

10. Termination

This Agreement remains in effect until terminated.

Licensor may terminate this Agreement with immediate effect if Licensee violates any provision of
this Agreement, without prejudice to any rights or claims accrued prior to termination.

Upon termination, Licensee shall immediately cease all use of the Licensed Technology and destroy
or permanently delete all copies in its possession or control.

Copies that are infeasible to delete using commercially reasonable efforts, including archival
backups or system snapshots not reasonably accessible in the ordinary course of operations, may be
retained solely for record-keeping or legal compliance purposes.

Any retained copies shall remain subject to this Agreement and shall not be accessed, used,
restored, reactivated, or relied upon for any purpose.

---

12. Publicity, Discussion, and Attribution

Licensee is free to discuss, review, benchmark, and share experiences with the Licensed Technology,
including in public forums, presentations, publications, and academic or technical materials.

Such discussions and publications must not:
a) disclose confidential or proprietary information of Licensor that is not publicly available;
b) disclose source code or non-public technical implementation details of the Licensed Technology;
c) state or imply that Licensor has endorsed, certified, approved, or entered into a partnership,
   sponsorship, or formal agreement with Licensee, unless expressly agreed to in writing.

available or independently developed by Licensee.

Subject to compliance with this Agreement, Licensor grants Licensee a limited, non-exclusive,
non-transferable, and revocable right to use the name “Solidean” and Licensor’s unmodified Solidean
logo solely to indicate factual use of the Licensed Technology, including phrases such as “Powered
by Solidean” or “Uses Solidean”, in documentation, marketing materials, user interfaces, or public
communications, provided that:

a) such use is truthful, accurate, and not misleading;
b) such use does not imply endorsement, certification, partnership, or sponsorship by Licensor;
c) the logo is used only in an attribution or secondary context and is not displayed more
   prominently than Licensee’s own branding; and
d) Licensor may revoke this permission at any time upon written notice.

No other rights to Licensor’s trademarks, service marks, or branding are granted under this
Agreement. Licensor encourages, but does not require, Licensees to include such attribution where
reasonably appropriate.


---

13. General Provisions

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, the remaining provisions shall
remain in full force and effect.

No waiver or modification of this Agreement shall be binding unless made in writing and signed by
an authorized representative of Licensor.

This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties concerning the Licensed
Technology and supersedes all prior agreements relating to its subject matter.
