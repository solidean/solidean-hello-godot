Solidean - Hello Godot

A minimal demo showing how Solidean can be used in a Godot project to compute sphere-mesh intersections and differences.
Clicking subtracts a sphere from the currently selected mesh and adds the intersection as a rigid body particle. The mesh's static body is updated as well.

Controls:
LMB: Apply tool
MMB: Orbit
Mouse wheel (+ Shift): Zoom (resize tool)

Timings are displayed to illustrate that the Solidean operations themselves account for only a small fraction of the total update time.
